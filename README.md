# PinkTok
An Interactive Marketplace based in San Diego, CA

## Description
An interactive site of all of my current listings for sale on Facebook Marketplace. In an attempt to make a more user-friendly interface than the current state of Marketplace, this project aims to improve search functionality and acts as an anchor point for all listings while viewing products.

## Features
* Sort by name or price, ascending or descending
* Keyword search allows for combined brand searching
* Punctuation leniency ("r.e.m. Beauty" is simply "rem")
* Faster dynamic filtering
* Count of all filtered items
* Subtle reactive color changes when hovering over searchbar or sort menu
* Reactive images slightly expand when hovered
* Information on previous prices as well as bulk pricing
* Mobile UI for modern iPhone models (15 Pro to 17 Pro Max)

### Coming Soon
Additional features coming soon:
* Item descriptions before redirecting to Marketplace
* Suggestions/Autocomplete
* History of Recent Searches
* Tag filtering
* Lazy Loading (As data increases)
* Dark Mode
* Price Range Filters
* Error Tolerance
* Natural Language Processing
